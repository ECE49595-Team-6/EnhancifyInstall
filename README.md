# Enhancify Installation

1. Make sure you have downloaded the Spotify desktop app directly from the Spotify website.
2. Go to the latest release on our GitHub and download the asset labelled "Source code (zip)".
3. Locate the downloaded asset in your file explorer, right-click it, and extract it.
    a. If you are on Windows you will click on "Extract All...". When the pop-up appears, check the box labelled "Show extracted files when complete" and then click "Extract" in the bottom-right.
4. Open the extracted folder and locate the corresponding installation script for your computer ("install.sh" for Mac and "install.ps1" for Windows).
    a. If you are on Windows:
        - Right-click the installation script and go to "Properties". At the bottom next to the "Security" label, check the "Unblock" box.
        - Also go to Settings and click on "System" (on the left navigation bar). Under "System" go to "For developers", click on "PowerShell", and turn on the setting starting with "Change execution policy..."
5. Finally, right-click the installation script and run it!
    a. If you are on Windows, select "Run with Powershell".
6. All done! If the Enhancify tab does not appear on the top-left navigation bar, close the Spotify desktop app and restart it.
